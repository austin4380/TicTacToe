# TicTacToe
TicTacToe game in 2 variants: One with a GUI and one played in the console

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- IDE of your choice to run the application

## Running the application

There are two different variants of Tic Tac Toe in this repository. One is a console based game which is the TicTacToe.py file. The other uses tkinter to have a
graphical user interface (GUI) to make the game more easier to play. This can be found in the TicTacToeApp.py file.

Import the project into your IDE of choice (I use Visual Studio Code). Execute either of the above files depending on which style of the game you want to play and
follow the directions.
